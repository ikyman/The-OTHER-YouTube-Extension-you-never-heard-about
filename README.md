# The OTHER YouTube Extension you never heard about 😂🍆🔥🔥🔥😱

Clickbait, we know it, we hate it, we can't escape it. Or can we? 

This is what this extension does. I identify YouTube Video title patterns that I take umbridge with. This extension then identifies videos that follow such irksome patterns and gives them a good roughing-up.


## Wait, the Other Youtube Extension?

Origionally, I was going to make an extension stopping youtube from Auto-playing obsessively. Every time I open a video in a new tab, it starts playing. No! I did not ask you to start playing! I opened a new tab! If I pause a video, switch tabs, and switch tabs back, does that auto-play my video? No! Why should switching over to a tab for the very first time be any different?

I suspect the code for that would be in the player base.js.

Unfortunently, the base.js has been minifier. It is nigh impossible to parse. I figured this Youtube Change is a poor candidate for my first Chrome Extension. Thus, the anti-clickbait extension.
